Botpress + Make + Stack AI will require more time (2-3 months), especially because Botpress involves some coding, custom integrations, and complex workflows. 
As a software engineer, you'll appreciate the flexibility and control it gives you, but it will take a bit more time to master.

Voiceflow + Zapier + Stack AI is more beginner-friendly due to the no-code platforms (Voiceflow and Zapier), which will allow you to rapidly prototype and deploy solutions. 
With your background, you can focus on understanding API integrations, the AI components, and automation workflows. You should be able to learn this combination in 1.5-2 months.

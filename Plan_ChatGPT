Detailed Plan for Starting an AI Automation Side Hustle Using Zapier and Make (Integromat)
Considering you're a 9-to-5 employee and have limited time, this plan will be tailored to allow you to start slowly, learn progressively, and offer services on the side without overwhelming yourself. We'll focus on Zapier and Make, two powerful tools that are beginner-friendly yet scalable for automation needs.

Total Time Commitment:
2-4 hours per week: This will be the time commitment for the first 4-6 weeks as you build your skills and start offering services.
2-4 hours per week after: Once you’re comfortable, you can allocate 2-4 hours to actively work with clients, implement more complex workflows, and continue learning.
This timeline assumes you're starting from scratch with no prior knowledge of automation. The key will be learning by doing, focusing on small, manageable projects, and gradually scaling your offerings.

Phase 1: Getting Comfortable with the Tools (Weeks 1-2)
Goal: Learn the basics of Zapier and Make, understand how to automate basic tasks, and gain hands-on experience.
Weekly Commitment: 2-4 hours per week
Day 1–2: Set up accounts on Zapier and Make (Integromat).

Zapier: Start with a free plan and create a few basic automations (e.g., connecting Gmail and Google Sheets, or automating Google Calendar events).
Make: Set up a free account, explore the interface, and learn the basic features like setting up a scenario (workflow) and connecting apps.
Day 3–5: Zapier Basics: Automating Simple Tasks.

Automate basic workflows:
Example 1: Automatically save email attachments from Gmail to Google Drive.
Example 2: Create a new task in Trello whenever a new email arrives in Gmail with specific keywords.
Follow tutorials to understand the core features of Zapier (like Triggers, Actions, and Filters).

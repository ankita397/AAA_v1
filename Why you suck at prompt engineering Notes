Markdown Formatting
Structure your prompt using markdown headings (H1, H2, H3) to enhance readability for both you and the LLM. While there's no definitive research on its direct impact, markdown formatting provides a clear structure, which may improve the LLM's understanding.
Example:
Use H1 headings (# Heading) for the main components: Role, Task, Specifics, Context, Examples, Notes.
Use H2 or H3 headings (## Subheading, ### Sub-subheading) to break down sections further, like within the Context or Examples.

Additional Considerations
Context Length and Costs: For high-volume tasks, keep the prompt concise to minimise token usage and costs.
Choice of Model: Start with the cheapest and fastest model that meets your requirements.
Temperature: Use a temperature of 0 for tasks requiring consistent output. For creative tasks, experiment with higher temperatures (0.5-1).
Positive Reinforcement: Frame instructions and feedback positively.
Personification: Consider assigning a persona to the role, particularly someone known for expertise in the relevant field.
By implementing these techniques and tailoring them to your specific needs, you can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of your LLM interactions.

Explanation of Changes:
H1 Headings (# Heading): Used for the main prompt title and the main components: Role, Task, Chain of Thought, Specifics, Context, Examples, and Notes.
H2 Headings (## Heading): Used to separate individual examples within the "Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)" section. This allows for better organisation when multiple examples are provided.
Bold Text: Used for "Input" and "Output" under each example to further highlight these elements for the LLM.
Additional Considerations:
The number of examples provided under "Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)" can be adjusted based on the task complexity and the desired level of guidance for the LLM. Three to five examples are generally recommended.
Remember to maintain clear and concise language throughout the prompt to avoid confusing the LLM.
